WAGES HIKE AND PRODUCTIVITY

The desire for rising consumption profiles
Frank and Hutchens (1993) have investigated the factors that may cause wage profiles
to rise in ways that are not explained by increases in productivity. In particular they
examined the cases of airline pilots and intercity bus drivers, both of whom have
relatively constant productivity over most of their careers, but have average annual
earnings at the end of their careers 600% higher and 50% higher, respectively, than at
the start of their careers. The authors rejected four existing explanations of the rising
wage profiles, relating to an investment in firm-specific capital, binding contracts, risk aversion, and adverse selection, before proposing a theory relating to commitment.
The workers involved had to commit to accepting lower earnings than was justified
by their productivity in the early years of their careers. It was further argued that such
commitment is more likely in circumstances where much of the social activity of the
workers involved is with fellow workers, and they showed that this is indeed the case
with the two groups of workers they studied. Although the evidence in the study was by
no means conclusive, being limited to only two groups of workers, it is highly suggestive.

Questions
1 What are the behavioral factors underlying a preference for rising wage and consumption
profiles?
2 Explain why pilots and bus drivers have relatively constant productivity over their career.
3 Explain why investment in firm-specific capital cannot satisfactorily account for rising
wage profiles as far as airline pilots and intercity bus drivers are concerned.
4 Explain the role of commitment in causing rising wage profiles, and why social activity
with fellow workers is important as far as the likelihood of commitment is concerned.
