Dear students
Read the case and then answer the questions

In a metropolitan city a new
metro rail project has been sanctioned. The project is expected to reduce
traffic congestion, lower pollution levels in the city and save a significant
amount of fossil fuel. However, the project requires construction of a car shed
for the metro terminus station.The city is already very congested and not much
land is available except a patch of green belt within the municipal area. Consequently,
the municipal corporation’s Tree Authority approved a proposal to cut down about
2700 trees to make way for the metro car shed.The approval enraged environment
action and citizens’ groups who have organized protest rallies demanding
withdrawal of this order and conservation of the green belt. The print and
electronic media also took up the cause.


1.If you are the Municipal
Commissioner, what course of action would you adopt keeping in mind the
interests of different stakeholders?
